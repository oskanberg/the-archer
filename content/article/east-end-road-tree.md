This beautiful weeping cherry tree has lifted the spirits of anyone passing the patch of open land at the junction of East End Road and Church Lane, N2, throughout the last two months.

So glorious has the tree’s cascading blossom been that one Facebook user couldn’t resist posting a number of photos and calling it “my favourite tree in East Finchley”.

Others agreed and her post attracted dozens of appreciative comments, with many noting how the tree’s elegant canopy gives its beauty a different shape from every angle.

Are there any other trees out there who have their own fan club?
