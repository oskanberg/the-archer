Even in our strange new world, the Budgens delivery man on a bike with a trailer is still worth a second glance. The man himself, Keir Patterson, told us that several of his customers have likened him to Granville in the old television show Open All Hours.

Keir and his colleagues have certainly been working all hours to keep many of us supplied. When The Archer caught up with him after Easter, he had just had his first days off “for a good long while”. He is actually the admin manager at Budgens, but when store manager Paul Gardner came up with the idea of delivering, he was happy to take it on.

# Along came a spider

“It’s my own bike, and I cycle in every day from Notting Hill,” said Keir. “Getting it all done is hard work. I feel like the spider in the centre of the web, but it’s not just me. It’s all of us. Things are so hectic that I do worry in case people can’t get through on the phone or details get lost. If you can’t get through first time, please try again.”

As well as the dozens of phone requests, there are over 30 online deliveries a day. “It’s getting the stuff off the shelves that takes a lot of time.”

# Delivery plans

Keir’s trailer can take 100 kilos, which corresponds to three or four smaller deliveries or one very large one. It’s weight that counts of course, and tinned goods make up a good proportion of sales. At the time of writing there were plans to take on a trainee to help, and Paul Gardner and an assistant also deliver from a conventional van.

Budgens had actually started a delivery service before the Covid19 crisis, but it was in its very early stages, with just a few customers. Keir thinks that deliveries will continue after the crisis.

“It’s very worthwhile,” he told us. “I do get a sense of fulfilment.”
