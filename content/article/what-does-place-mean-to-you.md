As part of my end of year degree show project, I aim to produce at least four or five abstract versions for each person of the places that you describe. I shall also be taking an audio recording of the interview and placing them next to the landscape drawings.

The concept for the project is this idea of an exchange. In return for your stories, I hope to create and give back to you an image which reminds you of that special place. Free coffee shall be provided for anyone wishing to participate.

Keeping to oil pastels and pens, I often produce vibrantly marked and small-scale draw-ings. Contrasting primary colours and creating visual interest, my influences include artists like David Hockney. Their use of colour and expression has always fascinated me as they manage to force the viewer to escape reality, evoking happiness.

For the project, I would like to maintain my colourful style whilst also exploring the freedom of my imagination. You can reach me by email at abiifuller@outlook.com or mobile 07958 361872 if you would like to get involved.
