        <h1>Traders forced to turn away customers as power cuts hit</h1>

            <p>Businesses and homes in the High Road between Kitchener Road and Beresford Road found themselves without electricity for nine hours on Friday 13 December and for up to another 10 hours on Saturday 14 December at the height of the pre-Christmas shopping season.</p>
            <h2>Cancellations and  candlelight trading</h2>
            <p>Optometrist David Hillel had to cancel a full NHS clinic on the Saturday morning, all of the machines at Heck of a Wash launderette were put out of action and East Finchley Electrical could not raise their shop shutters. Casa Pepe and the North London Hospice were unable to open, while Pacey’s newsagents did their best to trade by candlelight.</p>
            <p>Chef Khalid Harichi, pictured above, had to turn away 25 diners from his Table du Marche restaurant on the Friday evening. “We lost a lot of business,” he said. “Friday evenings and Saturdays are when we make most of our money and we had to cancel a lot of bookings. Our customers were very understanding but it was frustrating.”</p>
